<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The SP ontology reuse and expand The Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) to represent the document aspects in the protocol. To describe the experimental protocol as a workflow we reuse and expand experimental actions from EXACT; and reuse and expand terms related to instruments, reagents/chemical compounds, organisms and sample/specimen from ontologies such as: The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) , The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO), eagle-i resourse ontology (ERO), NCBI taxonomy and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI).</span>
